# AggieAnalystBot (Public Version)

Bot to play a spy image game in discord, for Howdy Hack 2020 (Theme:Spy)

-----------------------------------------------------

Intelligence analysis is a crucial part of the espionage and spying. Any competent agent should be able to identify key landmarks. 

A Spy (Aggie Freshman) can use this discord bot to familiarize themselves with their new mission environment (The Texas A&M Campus). Current Aggies can enjoy the bot too as a fun game.

-----------------------------------------------------

The discord bot will load in a random image of a Texas A&M University location (the current 1.0 Version has 10 images) into a discord server. Users can reply with the name of the location (a key will be given) in order to check and see if they got it right.
